		<h1>Suggestions for COMI-1750</h1>
		
		<p class="suggestions-text">This class was very enjoyable for me. I liked the content and the projects.
		I was able to learn everything I needed for the class through the PowerPoint
		presentations posted on BlackBoard and through the book. However, I do really
		feel like I get more out of an in-person lecture than I do from anything else.
		I like that we were always able to email with any other questions we add, and
		office hours were always availiable, but there's just something about being in-person
		in a classroom and being able to raise your hand and get clairification on something
		in real time. I feel like I would've gotten more out of an in-person class.</p>
