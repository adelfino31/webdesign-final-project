				<h1>The <span class="code">a</span> Element</h1>
				<p class="indent">The <span class="code">"a"</span> element, written as this: < a >, is used to create a hyperlink. 
				You can use <span class="code">"a"</span> to link to other websites, pages within the site you're using, links to 
				start another program, links to other places on the current webpage, to just name a few.</p>
				<p class="indent">There are two important parts to this element. The first one is called
				the destination. This is the actual link that you can find either in the search bar of any
				website, or if you are linking to a file, you would put the file name as the destination
				with the file extension. The second part of this element is called the label. The label
				is the part that will be visible on the webpage. It's the part that the user will click
				on to take them to the external link. A link would be written like this:</p>
				<p class="indent"> <span class="code"> &lt;a href="https://ccri.edu">CCRI's Homepage&lt;/a&gt;</span></p>
				<p class="indent">This line of code would take the user to the website "ccri.edu" if 
				clicked on, since that is the destination. And since the label is "CCRI's Homepage," that
				is what would show on the site. Also, notice that the element is closed with &lt;/a&gt;. This 
				is how most elements are closed in HTML, with a forward slash and the name of the element again.
				If I used this line of code on this webpage, this is exactly how it would appear:</p>
				<p class="indent"><a href="https://ccri.edu/">CCRI's Homepage</a></p>
